## Install instructions (Anaconda)

First install the anaconda distribution for your system.
This will install the most recent python distribution and several other programs such as the spyder editor, as well as manage your python enviornments.

These enviornments provide you a clean install of python where you can install different versions of python, and different sets of packages without worrying about compatibility issues.

You can follow the installation instructions on the official [Anaconda website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

## Install instructions (package requirements)

After you have confirmed your python installation is working properlly install the required packages using the provided requirements.txt file:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

You can install this in the default environment as these packages are often used in most python programs.

After, execute the test script "importTest.py" to make sure everything is properly installed.

The output is color coded, so if every line is green everything should be correct.
